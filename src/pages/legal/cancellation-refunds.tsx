              At Tech Vexor we aim to deliver high-quality services and a transparent experience. This policy explains how cancellations and refunds are handled for consultations, retainers, projects, subscriptions, and any product purchases made through our platform.
            </p>

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
              This policy applies to all paid engagements, including one-time professional services, recurring subscriptions, and product purchases, unless a separate written agreement or Statement of Work (SOW) specifies different terms.
            </p>

            <h2>Cancellation</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Pre-Engagement: If you cancel before work begins or before a non-refundable payment is used, we will issue a full refund minus any processing fees where applicable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Projects & SOWs: For ongoing projects, cancellations must be communicated in writing. Charges for time and materials completed up to the cancellation date, plus any non-recoverable third-party costs, will apply.
              </li>
              <li>
                Subscriptions: You may cancel subscription services at any time. Cancellation prevents future billing but does not automatically refund periods already paid unless otherwise stated in your plan or promotional terms.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Refunds</h2>
            <p>
              Refund eligibility depends on the service type and timing:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                One-time Services: Refunds for one-time engagements are considered on a case-by-case basis. If work has not commenced and no non-recoverable costs were incurred, we typically issue a full refund.
              </li>
              <li>
                Recurring Services: For subscription plans, we may offer pro-rata refunds for unused time at our discretion and in accordance with the plan terms.
              </li>
              <li>
                Products: Refunds for physical or digital products follow our product-specific return policy (see Shipping & Returns). Defective or materially non-conforming products will be repaired, replaced, or refunded.
              </li>
              <li>
                Payment Disputes: If a payment is disputed through your payment provider, we will cooperate with the investigation and may provisionally suspend services until the dispute is resolved.
              </li>
            </ul>
